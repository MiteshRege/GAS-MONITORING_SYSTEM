# GAS-MONITORING_SYSTEM
A gas detector is to ease humans on detecting the presence of those dangerous gases within an area to prevent disaster.   Nowadays, the gas detector has been innovated into various ways of detection, for example infrared thermal imaging gas leak detection, gas leakage detection with monitoring system, and wireless gas sensor network.    This project has designed and developed a wireless gas monitoring system by using Arduino and ThingSpeak
